# BlockNinja
A Fruit Ninja-like game written in Pythonista 3, for iOS/iPad. 

## Install (super easy)
This is the first release of BlockNinja! Download BlockNinja.py from [here](https://github.com/Legend-of-iPhoenix/BlockNinja/releases/download/v1.0/BlockNinja.py) and get [Pythonista 3](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pythonista-3/id1085978097?mt=8) from the App Store (if you don't already have it). Load the BlockNinja.py file into Pythonista, and you're all set to play!

## Features
It features a high scores table, streaks, bombs, crits, a timer, advanced particle effects, and lots of obscure hacks and shims in the code because it wouldn't be a game written by me without them.

Enjoy!
